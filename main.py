    We have broken up the program into per-file generation. 
    Now your job is to generate only the code for the file {filename}. 
    Make sure to have consistent filenames if you reference other files we are also generating.
    
    Remember that you must obey 3 things: 
       - you are generating code for the file {filename}
       - do not stray from the names of the files and the shared dependencies we have decided on
       - MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL - the purpose of our app is {prompt} - every line of code you generate must be valid code. Do not include code fences in your response, for example

    ```javascript

    ```
    
    Good response:
    console.log("hello world")
